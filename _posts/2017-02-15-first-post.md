# Why?

During my daily tasks as a developer I occasionally run into issues that no amount of Googling, Stack Overflow-ing will yield a solution to. My current stack (Spring Boot, MySQL 5.7+, Angular 2 + Bootstrap 4) comprises of relatively recent technologies which have limited literature and discussion online.

As of now, I'm using this blog to post solutions (hacks or production sufficient) to problems that I either could not find online, or had to string together a bunch of other solutions to solve
